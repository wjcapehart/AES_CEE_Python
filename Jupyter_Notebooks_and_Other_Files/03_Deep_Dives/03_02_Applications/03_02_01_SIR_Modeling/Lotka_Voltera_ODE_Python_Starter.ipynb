    "Also, in looking at this kind of behavior in general, different system models showing alternative interactions (like giving the herbivore a _limited_ food source) will have different behaviors.  For example, some scenarios can spiral to a single convergence point.  Others have tipping points to where both populations may crash, or one population explodes to the determent of other interacting \"players.\"  Some Differential Equation Classes will show ways to anticpate these behaviors by working with the raw equations.  \n",
