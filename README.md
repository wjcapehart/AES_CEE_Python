## About this Site

This page is a collection of "deep dives" that slowly work through basic issues on spinning up Python for beginners.  It covers the basics of getting started with Python in a Jupyter Notebook and emphasizes things that made me want to rage-quit in my transition to Python.  Consequently, a lot of the material here is slightly cheeky (and sometimes not-so cheeky).

This differs from many tutorial sites and "example" pages out there as my demos presented here slooowwwwwllllyy build the activity step-by-step adding small modifications one element at a time.  (In my experience being flooded with everything at once has led to me having to close my door for the benefit of my neighboring colleagues.)


## "Where would Dr Capehart go?"  

If you want to see where I went for my general Python training, it's this site right here.  This presumes a strong comfort in programming in general and some basic Python literacy.

*  [Jake Vanderplas's Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/)

However, the PDSH does not include things like mapping, working with XArray, MetPy, or other specialized applications.

For those, I tend to mostly JFGIing it or holding my breath and diving into Stack Overflow.
